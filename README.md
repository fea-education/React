## Guide

There are tons of tutorials out there. Some are great, some of them aren't. If you are new to [React](https://reactjs.org/) it can be a bit overwhelming where to start and what really to focus on at first. Therefore I set up this little guide.

There are also alternative guides like [Kent C. Dodds'](https://kentcdodds.com/) [How to React](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-react) and [The Complete Introduction to React](https://jscomplete.com/learn/complete-intro-react#top).

But here comes my proposal for you:

1. Before diving into React it might be helpful to check on your exisiting skills regarding the [Web Fundamentals](#web-fundamentals), like HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

2. After that you should learn [React Fundamentals](#react-fundamentals), strapped of all the additional complexity, that you will encounter when setting up your own React projects.

3. Once you have a basic understanding of the API of React, you can focus on different, connected topics like [Project Setup](#project-setup), [Routing](#routing), [State Management](#state-management), more [Advanced Component Patterns](#advanced-component-patterns) and the React [Hooks API](#hooks-api).

4. The beauty (and ugly) of React is it's openess. It is not a complete framework, it does mainly one thing for you and that is build up the Browsers DOM based on the components you wrote and the data you pour into them. You will have the freedom and responsibility to choose from endless options. So I'll give you a few ideas of [Where to go from here](#where-to-go-from-here).

### Web Fundamentals

Working with Web Applications, you'll often find yourself on either [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) or the great [Mozilla Developer Netweork (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) to find answers. The MDN hosts a very informative documentation on [anything related to the Web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web), like the browser APIs, and it's technologies.

If you are unfamiliar with Web Fundamentals like HTML, CSS and JavaScript, you should start at [Learn web development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn). If you have some knowledge in those technologies already, you should refresh your JavaScript knowledge with [A re-introduction to JavaScript (JS tutorial)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) and [ES6 for beginners](https://hackernoon.com/es6-for-beginners-f98120b57414).

### React Fundamentals

After being done with the [Web Fundamentals](#web-fundamentals), you can start learning React. My advise, start with the [Main Concepts](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html), following by the [Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) of the [React Website](https://reactjs.org/).

You will not have to set up a local project - My advise: Leave that for later when you feel comfortable with JavaScript and React. Use the provided CodePen links to try out what is presented to you.

### Project Setup

_todo... Babel, Webpack/Parcel, Create React App_

### Routing

_todo... React Router_

### Advanced Component Patterns

_todo... Compound, Higher Order, Render Props, Hooks_

### State Management

_todo... Local, Context, Redux, Others_

### Where to go from here

So what next you're asking? Well with React it never really ends... hopefully.

#### News

There are some places, like the [official React Blog](https://reactjs.org/blog) that you should definitely take a look at once in a while.

Other good blogs I like to follow are from [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/) - He used to work for paypal and release all kinds of goodies. He is a fulltime educator now, which unfortunately resulted in the decline of his free material. Still worth it to check out - and [Mark Erikson](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/) - A Redux maintainer.

Besides that there is [daily.dev](https://daily.dev/) which gives you all kinds of development oriented articles. It comes with a really nice browser extension for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dailydev-news-for-busy-de/jlmpjdjjbgclbocgajdjefcidcncaied) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/daily/) - my secret tip!

I also started organising some interesting or constantly occurring development/IT related topics in a little [GitHub repo](https://fea17e86.github.io/dev-howtos), it also contains some [React articles](https://fea17e86.github.io/dev-howtos/?selectedTags=react).

#### TypeScript

_todo... Why, Setup, Docs/Articles/Tutorials_

#### CSS in JS

_todo... CSS Modules, Styled Components_

#### Testing

_todo... Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress.io_

#### React based Frameworks

_todo... Gatsby, Next_
